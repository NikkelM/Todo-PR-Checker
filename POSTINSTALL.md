Thank you for installing the Todo PR Checker app!
I hope that you'll find it useful and that it will help you and your team keep track of action items in your code.

Hosting and maintaining this app unfortunately is not free, so I appreciate your contribution to help keep it running - consider buying me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/nikkelm) or [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/NikkelM) this project.

Please also take a look at the [project readme](https://github.com/NikkelM/Todo-PR-Checker/blob/main/README.md) to learn how to configure the app to match your needs through a `.github/config.yml` file, and feel free to reach out and open an issue if you have any questions or need help.
