# Changelog

## v1.1.1

<!--Releasenotes start-->
- The app is more restrictive and efficient in handling received webhook events, meaning it only handles those events that are relevant to the app.
- Improved the maintainability and readability of the app and its code.
- The server now sends a different status code if a webhook was received, but not handled, which improves server-side debugging.
