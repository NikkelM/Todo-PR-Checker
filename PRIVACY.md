# Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of the GitHub app "Todo PR Checker" (hereby, "app"), developed by Nikkel Mollenhauer (hereby, "we", "us", "our", "developer).
The functionality of GitHub apps builds upon GitHub infrastructure, and as such, some data is processed by and transmitted from and/or to GitHub as part of the app's functionality.
If you have any questions about how your data is processed by GitHub, please refer to the GitHub privacy policy.

# What information does the app obtain and how is it used?
The app is granted a set of permissions to be notified of events in the repository or repositories you grant it access to.
These permissions are presented to you when you first install the app, where you must grant them in order for the app to function.
Whenever these permissions change, you will be notified and required to accept the change before the app will continue to function.
The permissions requested by the app are kept as minimal as possible, and are only used to deliver the functionality of the app.

When you perform certain actions in repositories to which the app has access (including, but not limited to, creating or updating a Pull Request), the app is notified of these actions through a webhook.
The information transmitted through these webhooks is secured by GitHub, and only readable by the app and authorized employees.
The webhooks contain information pertaining to the action you took, such as the file changes in a Pull Request.
The app uses this data to perform its function, and for no other reason.

The app does not persist any data beyond the duration of a request (where a "request" hereby is the reception, processing of, and response to, a webhook as described above), and does not store any data in any form.

# Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the app?
The app leverages Google Cloud services to build, deploy and host the app and deliver its functionality.
This means that any webhooks as described above are transmitted to and processed by Google Cloud services.
Beyond the scope of delivering the app's functionality, the data is not used in any other way by Google Cloud services, and not shared with any other third parties.

# Data Retention Policy
No data is retained in any form.
Data is only used during the duration of a request, and not stored in any way.

# Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. 
We limit access to this information to authorized employees who need access to the information in order to operate, develop or improve the app. 
Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

# Changes to the Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. 
We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. 
You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
